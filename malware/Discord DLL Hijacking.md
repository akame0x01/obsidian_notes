I saw @hackingnaweb creating an fully undetectable malware hijacking an discord dll and it looks quite interesting. I still don't now with I'm going too deep in this because i have almost a hundred projects that i started and just forget it for some time for some reason.

## Starting 

First of all I'll do some test about DLL(Dynamic Linked Libraries).

dlls are code like exes(Same PE File format) but cannot be eecutable directly. similat to .so files in Linux

.lib -> static libraries, are linked in the binary at compile time.
.dll -> dynamic, linked at binary run time. 

Loading a DLL:

A program loads a DLL at startup, via the Win32 API LoadLibrary, or when it is a dependency of another DLL. A program uses the GetProcAddress to load a function or LoadResource to load a resource


dll contains not only code but also data, can be shared and reused by multiple programs

In run-time dynamic linking, an application calls either the LoadLibrary function or the LoadLibraryEx function to load the DLL at run time. After the DLL is successfully loaded, you use the GetProcAddress function to obtain the address of the exported DLL function that you want to call. When you use run-time dynamic linking, you do not need an import library file.
