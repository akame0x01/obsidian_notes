hta payload delivery notes

HTA attack
This type of attack is a simple HTML application that can provide full access to the remote attacker. The usual file extension of an HTA is .hta. An HTA is treated like any executable file with the extension .exe. When executed via mshta.exe (or if the file icon is double-clicked), it runs immediately. When executed remotely via the browser, the user is asked once, before the HTA is downloaded, whether or not to save and run the application; if saved, it can simply be run on demand after that.

 This added functionality provides control over user interface design and access to the client system. Moreover, run as trusted applications, HTAs are not subject to the same security constraints as webpages. As with any executable file, the user is asked once, before the HTA is downloaded, whether to save or run the application; if saved to the client machine, it simply runs on demand thereafter. The end result is that an HTA runs like any executable (.exe) file written in C++ or Visual Basic.


 go throught this and try to create a simple and beauty hta file that get some code execution or even a little c2 agent delivered, try to use techniques to bypass av detections.
